# **Executive Summary**

This architecture document defines a **radically simplified voice AI appointment scheduling system** for healthcare practices, designed for **MVP delivery in 6-8 weeks** by a solo developer. The architecture prioritizes **deployability and maintainability** over technical sophistication, while providing **clear expansion paths** for future growth.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **Simplified monolithic deployment** instead of distributed microservices
- **Direct EMR integration** without local data synchronization complexity
- **Cloud voice processing** accepting cost for maximum simplicity
- **Minimal web dashboard** without complex frontend frameworks
- **File-based configuration** avoiding database administration overhead
- **Modular component design** enabling future expansion without rewrites
