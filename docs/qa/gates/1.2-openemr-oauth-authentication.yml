    notes: "PKCE and encryption excellent, but in-memory session storage poses risk for production. HIPAA audit logging properly implemented."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Async patterns, caching, and connection pooling provide good performance. Exponential backoff prevents overload."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Token refresh automation excellent, but session storage would cause failures on restart or scaling."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean architecture, comprehensive documentation, proper error handling, and 85% test coverage target met."
