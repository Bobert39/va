# Issues identified during review
top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Dashboard endpoints lack proper authentication middleware"
    suggested_action: "Implement authentication decorators for all dashboard endpoints before production"
    suggested_owner: "dev"
  - id: "SEC-002"
    severity: high
    finding: "No rate limiting on API endpoints"
    suggested_action: "Add rate limiting using existing SlowAPI middleware to prevent abuse"
    suggested_owner: "dev"
  - id: "ARCH-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "In-memory storage approach will not scale beyond single instance"
    suggested_action: "Replace with persistent session storage or Redis for production scalability"
    suggested_owner: "dev"
  - id: "SEC-003"
    severity: medium
    finding: "WebSocket connections don't verify user permissions"
    suggested_action: "Add WebSocket authentication handshake and user permission checks"
    suggested_owner: "dev"
  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Synchronous PDF generation could block event loop"
    suggested_action: "Implement async PDF generation or queue-based processing"
