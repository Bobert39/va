# Quality Gate Decision for Story 2.3
schema: 1
story: "2.3"
story_title: "Appointment Conflict Detection and Resolution"
gate: "CONCERNS"
status_reason: "Implementation is functionally complete but has code quality issues that should be addressed. Lint violations and test coverage gaps need resolution before production deployment."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

top_issues:
  - id: "LINT-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Extensive PEP8 violations in main service files (66 lint errors in conflict_detector.py alone)"
    suggested_action: "Run black formatter and fix flake8 violations before production"
  - id: "COV-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Test coverage at 7.50% - far below required 80% threshold"
    suggested_action: "Increase test coverage especially for error handling paths and edge cases"
  - id: "IMPORT-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Unused imports in multiple service files (typing.Optional, networking exceptions)"
    suggested_action: "Clean up unused imports to reduce technical debt"
  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Circular dependency potential in alternative time generation (conflict_detector calling itself)"
    suggested_action: "Review recursive alternative generation logic for performance impact"

    notes: "Caching implemented but recursive suggestion generation may impact performance under load"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling implemented, graceful degradation patterns present"
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Code quality issues with formatting and lint violations impact maintainability"
