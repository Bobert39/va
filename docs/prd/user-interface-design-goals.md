# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision (MVP)
Basic voice interaction that can schedule simple appointments with minimal admin interface for practice staff to monitor system. Designed within constraints of solo developer timeline, standard practice hardware, and existing healthcare workflows.

## Key Interaction Paradigms (MVP)
- **Voice-First**: Simple conversational flow (name → appointment type → preferred time → confirmation, 5-6 exchanges maximum)
- **Admin Simplicity**: Show today's AI appointments and system status with basic controls
- **Constraint-Driven Design**: Single-page web application using standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript only

## Core Screens and Views (MVP)
- **Voice Flow**: Basic appointment booking conversation with simple confirmation loop
- **Admin Dashboard**: Simple appointment list + system on/off switch + connection status indicator
- **Configuration Panel**: Provider schedule input and EMR connection settings only
- **System Status**: EMR API connectivity, voice service status, basic error logging

## Accessibility (MVP): Basic
Basic keyboard navigation for admin interface. Advanced WCAG compliance deferred to post-MVP due to resource constraints.

## Branding (MVP): Minimal
Clean, simple interface without custom branding requirements. Focus on functionality over aesthetics within 6-8 week timeline.

## Target Platforms (MVP): Desktop Only
Desktop web interface only, Chrome/Edge browser support, no responsive design needed. Designed for standard practice PC hardware (Windows 10+, 8GB RAM).

## Critical Design Constraints
- **Resource Limitations**: Solo developer, 6-8 week timeline, $197/month cost target
- **Technical Constraints**: Standard practice hardware, potential network limitations, HIPAA compliance requirements
- **Integration Dependencies**: OpenEMR API reliability, phone system compatibility, practice workflow integration
- **User Constraints**: Limited staff technical expertise, patient technology comfort levels, healthcare environment privacy requirements

## Post-MVP Production Notes
**Important features deferred from MVP that must be addressed for production deployment:**

- **Accessibility Compliance**: Full WCAG AA compliance required for production to ensure legal compliance and patient access
- **Multi-language Support**: English-only for MVP pilot, Spanish + local languages critical for diverse patient populations
- **Mobile Interface**: Desktop admin only for MVP, responsive design essential for staff mobility in production
- **Advanced Error Recovery**: Basic timeout sufficient for MVP, robust conversation state management needed for production
- **Patient Demographics**: MVP pilot with friendly early adopters, production must accommodate all patient comfort levels with technology
- **Staff Training & Change Management**: MVP works with willing pilot practices, production requires comprehensive training programs and change management
- **Performance Under Load**: MVP handles 1-2 concurrent calls maximum, production must support 5+ simultaneous calls per practice requirements
