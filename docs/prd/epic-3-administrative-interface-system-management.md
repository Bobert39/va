# Epic 3: Administrative Interface & System Management

**Expanded Goal:** Provide practice staff with essential operational tools to monitor, configure, and manage the voice AI system. This epic enables real-world deployment by giving practices control and visibility over system operations.

## Story 3.1: Real-Time Appointment Monitoring Dashboard
As a **practice manager**,
I want **to see all AI-scheduled appointments in real-time**,
so that **I can monitor system performance and verify bookings**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard displays all appointments scheduled by voice AI with timestamps
2. Real-time updates when new appointments are created
3. Color-coded status indicators (confirmed, pending, failed)
4. Filter options by date, provider, appointment type
5. Appointment details include patient name, contact info, booking source
6. Export functionality for appointment reports and analysis
7. Integration with existing appointment viewing from Epic 1

## Story 3.2: System Configuration and Practice Settings (Updated)
As a **practice administrator**,
I want **to configure system settings for our specific practice**,
so that **the voice AI works correctly with our providers, hours, and policies**.

### Acceptance Criteria (Updated)
1. Provider management (add/remove providers, set schedules, configure preferences)
2. Business hours configuration for voice AI availability
3. Appointment type setup with durations and scheduling rules
4. Practice information settings (name, address, phone, greeting customization)
5. **USER TESTING REQUIRED**: Configuration tested by actual healthcare staff with limited technical expertise
6. **SIMPLIFIED INTERFACE**: Setup wizard approach rather than complex configuration screens
7. All configuration changes take effect immediately without system restart

## Story 3.3: System Health and Status Monitoring
As a **practice staff member**,
I want **clear visibility into system health and connectivity**,
so that **I know when the system is working properly or needs attention**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Real-time status indicators for EMR connectivity, voice services, and web interface
2. Connection test buttons for manual verification of system components
3. Error log display with timestamps and severity levels
4. Performance metrics (response times, success rates, call volume)
5. Alert notifications for system failures or degraded performance
6. Simple restart/reset options for common issues
7. Contact information for technical support when needed

## Story 3.4: Manual Appointment Override and Management
As a **practice staff member**,
I want **the ability to modify or cancel AI-scheduled appointments**,
so that **I can handle special cases and patient requests**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Edit appointment details (time, provider, notes) with EMR synchronization
2. Cancel appointments with automatic notification to EMR system
3. Add manual appointments that integrate with AI scheduling logic
4. Override appointment conflicts when clinically necessary
5. Audit trail of all manual changes with staff member identification
6. Bulk operations for rescheduling during provider unavailability
7. Patient contact information readily available for follow-up calls
