# Epic List

Based on the Voice AI Platform requirements and MVP scope, here's the high-level epic structure:

## **Epic 1: Foundation & EMR Integration**
Establish project infrastructure, OpenEMR authentication, and basic patient lookup capabilities while delivering initial appointment viewing functionality.

**Success Criteria:**
- 100% successful OAuth 2.0 connection to OpenEMR test instance
- Patient lookup queries return results in <3 seconds with 100% accuracy on test dataset (minimum 20 patients)
- Successfully retrieve provider schedules for current day + next 30 days
- Demo to practice staff shows live patient lookup with no PHI exposure in logs

## **Epic 2: Voice Interface & Basic Appointment Scheduling**
Implement voice-to-text processing, natural language understanding, and core appointment creation workflow with EMR integration.

**Success Criteria:**
- ≥90% voice recognition accuracy on test phrases from 5+ different speakers
- Successfully books appointments with 0% double-booking rate
- Voice processing + EMR booking completes in <10 seconds end-to-end
- 80% of voice interactions reach successful appointment confirmation
- Voice AI books appointment that appears correctly in OpenEMR with conflict detection working

## **Epic 3: Administrative Interface & System Management**
Create web-based admin dashboard for appointment monitoring, system configuration, and practice staff management tools.

**Success Criteria:**
- Admin dashboard loads in <2 seconds with real-time updates
- Practice settings (hours, providers, phone) save and persist correctly
- System status accurately reflects EMR connectivity and voice service health
- Practice staff can configure system without developer assistance
- All AI-scheduled appointments visible with complete audit trail

## **Epic 4: Production Readiness & Pilot Deployment**
Implement error handling, audit logging, HIPAA compliance features, and deployment packaging for pilot practice installation.

**Success Criteria:**
- Single installer deploys complete system in <30 minutes on target hardware
- System runs 24+ hours without crashes or memory leaks
- HIPAA compliance checklist 100% complete with documentation
- System recovers gracefully from 95% of anticipated failure scenarios
- Successful installation on practice hardware by non-technical staff with 48-hour stress test validation

## **Epic 5: Documentation & Developer Experience**
Transform the Voice AI Platform from a technically sophisticated but underdocumented system into a fully accessible, maintainable, and onboardable project through comprehensive documentation.

**Success Criteria:**
- New developer can make first meaningful contribution within 3 days
- 95% of users successfully complete setup following documentation
- 70% reduction in basic setup and troubleshooting support questions
- External developers can complete basic API integration in <2 hours
- All documentation tested and validated with actual users

**Success Measurement Timeline:**
- **Week 2**: Epic 1 success criteria met → Continue with confidence
- **Week 4**: Epic 2 success criteria met → Core value proposition proven
- **Week 6**: Epic 3 success criteria met → Operational readiness achieved
- **Week 8**: Epic 4 success criteria met → Pilot deployment ready

**Risk Mitigation Strategy:**
Success criteria **front-load technical risk** (EMR integration uncertainty) while **back-loading operational complexity** (deployment, monitoring). This ensures that if technical barriers emerge, they're discovered early when pivot options remain available.
