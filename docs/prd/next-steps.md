# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt
"Review the attached Voice AI Platform PRD, particularly the UI Design Goals section and Epic 3 (Administrative Interface). Create UX wireframes and user flows for the administrative dashboard, focusing on simplicity for healthcare staff with limited technical expertise. Priority areas: appointment monitoring interface, basic system configuration, and error state handling. Consider HIPAA compliance requirements for PHI display and ensure designs accommodate the MVP constraint of desktop-only deployment."

## Architect Prompt
"Review the attached Voice AI Platform PRD and Technical Assumptions section. Design the system architecture for this voice-powered appointment scheduling platform with OpenEMR integration. Critical requirements: on-premise deployment, solo developer maintainability, $197/month operational cost target, and HIPAA compliance. Priority focus areas: phone system integration options, voice processing pipeline (local vs cloud), OAuth authentication with OpenEMR, and database schema for appointments/audit logging. Please validate OpenEMR appointment creation API functionality first before finalizing voice interface architecture."
