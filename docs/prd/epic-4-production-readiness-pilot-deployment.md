# Epic 4: Production Readiness & Pilot Deployment

**Expanded Goal:** Transform the working prototype into a production-ready system suitable for pilot practice deployment. This epic focuses on reliability, security, compliance, and operational support requirements.

## Story 4.1: Comprehensive Error Handling and Recovery
As a **practice relying on the voice AI system**,
I want **the system to handle errors gracefully and recover automatically**,
so that **patient appointment booking continues reliably even when problems occur**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Automatic retry logic for temporary EMR API failures
2. Graceful degradation when voice services become unavailable
3. Database transaction rollback for incomplete appointment creation
4. System restart capability after critical errors
5. Error notification to practice staff for issues requiring attention
6. Comprehensive logging of all error conditions and recovery actions
7. 95% of anticipated failure scenarios handled without manual intervention

## Story 4.2: HIPAA Compliance and Security Implementation (Updated)
As a **practice handling patient health information**,
I want **the system to meet all HIPAA compliance requirements**,
so that **we can use it confidently without regulatory risk**.

### Acceptance Criteria (Updated)
1. All PHI encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption
2. TLS 1.3 encryption for all network communications
3. Comprehensive audit logging of all PHI access and modifications
4. User authentication and session management with automatic timeouts
5. Access controls preventing unauthorized data access
6. **INDEPENDENT VALIDATION**: Third-party security audit or compliance review
7. **REALISTIC TIMELINE**: Allocate 30-40% of Epic 4 timeline to compliance validation

## Story 4.3: Installation Package and Deployment Automation (Updated)
As a **practice IT administrator**,
I want **simple installation and setup process**,
so that **we can deploy the system without extensive technical expertise**.

### Acceptance Criteria (Updated)
1. Single executable installer for Windows 10+ systems
2. Automated dependency installation and configuration
3. Setup wizard for initial practice configuration and EMR connection
4. Installation completes in under 30 minutes on target hardware
5. **REAL-WORLD TESTING**: Installation tested by actual practice IT staff, not developers
6. **PHONE INTEGRATION**: Clear documentation for phone system integration options
7. Uninstall process that cleanly removes all components

## Story 4.4: System Monitoring and Remote Support Capabilities
As a **developer supporting deployed systems**,
I want **remote monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities**,
so that **I can provide support without requiring on-site visits**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Remote system health monitoring with configurable alerts
2. Diagnostic information collection for troubleshooting
3. Remote configuration assistance without accessing PHI
4. System performance metrics and usage analytics
5. Automated backup verification and system integrity checks
6. Support ticket integration with practice contact information
7. Documentation and training materials for practice staff

## Story 4.5: Pilot Practice Preparation and Documentation
As a **pilot practice preparing to use the voice AI system**,
I want **comprehensive documentation and training materials**,
so that **our staff can operate the system effectively and confidently**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. User manual covering all practice staff operations
2. Installation and setup guide for IT administrators
3. Troubleshooting guide for common issues and solutions
4. Training videos for voice system operation and management
5. HIPAA compliance documentation for practice review
6. Emergency procedures and support contact information
7. Practice readiness checklist and go-live procedures
