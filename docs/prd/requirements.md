# Requirements

## Functional Requirements

**FR1:** The system must authenticate with OpenEMR instances using OAuth 2.0 with scope-based access control for secure API access.

**FR2:** The system must perform real-time speech-to-text transcription of patient appointment requests with >95% accuracy.

**FR3:** The system must extract appointment details from natural language including date, time, reason for visit, patient identification information, and symptom classification for appropriate appointment type selection.

**FR4:** The system must lookup existing patients in the EMR system using FHIR R4 patient search endpoints.

**FR5:** The system must retrieve provider schedules and identify available appointment slots to prevent double-booking.

**FR6:** The system must detect scheduling conflicts and offer alternative appointment times when requested slots are unavailable.

**FR7:** The system must create new appointments in the EMR system through documented appointment creation APIs.

**FR8:** The system must provide voice confirmation to patients including appointment details (date, time, provider, location).

**FR9:** The system must handle error scenarios gracefully, including API failures, network issues, and invalid patient information.

**FR10:** The system must log all appointment interactions for audit compliance and troubleshooting purposes.

**FR11:** The system must support after-hours operation without requiring staff intervention for routine appointment scheduling.

**FR12:** The system must verify active insurance, copay amounts, and prior authorization requirements when available in the EMR system.

**FR13:** The system must categorize appointment types (routine, urgent, consultation, follow-up) and apply appropriate scheduling rules and durations.

**FR14:** The system must respect provider-specific scheduling preferences, restrictions, and availability patterns.

**FR15:** The system must capture and respect patient communication preferences for confirmations and reminders (voice, text, email).

**FR16:** The system must manage waiting lists for fully booked time slots and automatically notify patients of cancellations.

**FR17:** The system must handle scheduling for family members with proper authorization verification and relationship tracking.

## Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1:** The system must respond to voice requests within 2 seconds to maintain natural conversation flow.

**NFR2:** The system must maintain 99.5% uptime during configured operational hours.

**NFR3:** The system must comply with HIPAA requirements including encryption at rest and in transit, audit logging, and access controls.

**NFR4:** The system must be deployable on-premise on standard practice PC hardware (Windows 10+, 8GB RAM, 100GB storage).

**NFR5:** The system must maintain API error rate below 1% for EMR integration operations.

**NFR6:** The system must support concurrent voice interactions for practices with multiple phone lines (up to 5 simultaneous calls).

**NFR7:** The system must minimize PHI exposure by processing voice data locally and transmitting only necessary appointment data to EMR.

**NFR8:** The system must provide automated backup and recovery mechanisms for appointment data and configuration.

**NFR9:** The system must be configurable for different practice workflows and provider schedules without code changes.

**NFR10:** The system must support future EMR integrations through modular architecture and standardized interfaces.

**NFR11:** The system must support Spanish and other common local languages based on practice demographics (minimum English + 1 additional language).
