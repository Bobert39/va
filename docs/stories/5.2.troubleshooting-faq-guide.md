## Dev Notes

### Error Analysis Sources
Based on existing implementation:
- **Audit Logs**: `audit.log` contains structured error information with timestamps
- **FastAPI Errors**: HTTP status codes and application exceptions
- **Service Errors**: EMR integration, voice processing, and scheduling service failures
- **Configuration Errors**: Validation failures and missing configuration issues

### Common Issue Categories
From development experience and architecture:
- **Installation Issues**: Poetry, Python version, dependency conflicts
- **Authentication Issues**: OAuth 2.0 setup, EMR credentials, API key problems
- **Performance Issues**: Response times >3 seconds, memory usage >1GB
- **Network Issues**: EMR connectivity, firewall blocking, port conflicts

### Diagnostic Tools Integration
Leverage existing monitoring:
- **Health Check Endpoints**: `/api/v1/status` and `/dev/status` for system validation
- **Provider Schedule Service**: Built-in health monitoring and cache validation
- **Audit Logging**: Structured JSON logs for error pattern analysis
- **Configuration Manager**: Built-in validation and encryption status checking

### User Support Scenarios
Different user types need different troubleshooting approaches:
- **Developers**: Technical debugging with log analysis and code-level solutions
- **System Administrators**: System-level diagnostics and configuration management
- **Practice Staff**: User-friendly solutions for common operational problems
- **DevOps Engineers**: Automated monitoring and alerting setup procedures

### Documentation Integration
Link with existing documentation:
- **Cross-Reference**: Link to setup guide, configuration reference, and architecture docs
- **Error Context**: Provide context from audit logs and system monitoring
- **Solution Validation**: Include test procedures to verify problem resolution
- **Escalation Path**: Clear guidance on when to seek additional support

### Testing Requirements
Troubleshooting guide validation:
- **Problem Simulation**: Create test scenarios for each documented issue
- **Solution Validation**: Verify all troubleshooting steps actually resolve problems
- **User Testing**: Have different user types attempt to resolve common issues
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Ensure all commands and procedures are correct and current
