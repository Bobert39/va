# Story 5.3: API Integration Guide

## Status
**TODO** - Ready for implementation

## Story
**As a** developer integrating with the Voice AI Platform or extending EMR functionality,
**I want** comprehensive API documentation with practical examples and integration patterns,
**so that** I can successfully implement integrations without guessing API behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Complete API Reference** - Document all endpoints with request/response examples, parameters, and error codes
2. **EMR Integration Patterns** - Best practices and examples for OpenEMR integration and FHIR R4 compliance
3. **Authentication Guide** - Detailed OAuth 2.0 implementation with token management and security practices
4. **SDK and Code Examples** - Ready-to-use code snippets in Python, JavaScript, and curl commands
5. **Webhook Documentation** - Event-driven integration patterns with payload examples and security
6. **Rate Limiting & Error Handling** - Comprehensive guidance on API limits, retry logic, and error recovery
7. **Testing and Validation Tools** - API testing procedures with Postman collections and validation scripts

## Dev Notes

### Current API Inventory
From existing FastAPI implementation:
- **Core Endpoints**: `/api/v1/status`, `/api/v1/appointments/*`, `/api/v1/providers`
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with timeout management
- **Dashboard API**: Web interface endpoints with real-time updates
- **Health Monitoring**: System status and diagnostic endpoints

### EMR Integration Architecture
Based on existing services:
- **Provider Schedule Service**: FHIR R4 compliant with automatic refresh and caching
- **FHIR Patient Service**: Patient lookup with PHI protection and audit logging
- **Appointment Service**: Full CRUD operations with conflict detection
- **OAuth Integration**: Secure EMR authentication with token management

### API Design Patterns
Current implementation follows:
- **RESTful Design**: Standard HTTP methods with resource-based URLs
- **JSON API**: Consistent request/response format with structured error handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in slowapi integration for DoS protection
- **Validation**: Pydantic models for request/response validation and serialization

### Integration Complexity Levels
Documentation should support:
- **Basic Integration**: Simple appointment lookup and display
- **Advanced Integration**: Full appointment management with conflict resolution
- **Custom EMR Integration**: Extending beyond OpenEMR to other EMR systems
- **Webhook Integration**: Real-time event processing and notification systems

### Security Considerations
Critical security documentation needs:
- **HIPAA Compliance**: PHI handling requirements and audit logging
- **OAuth 2.0 Security**: Proper token handling and scope management
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and SQL injection prevention
- **Network Security**: HTTPS requirements and certificate management

### Documentation Format
API documentation structure:
- **Interactive Documentation**: Enhance existing FastAPI OpenAPI docs
- **Code Examples**: Executable examples in multiple programming languages
- **Postman Collections**: Ready-to-import API testing collections
- **Integration Guides**: Step-by-step integration tutorials

### Testing Requirements
API documentation validation:
- **Example Accuracy**: All code examples must be tested and working
- **Postman Validation**: Collections must successfully execute against live API
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end integration examples must be validated
- **Security Testing**: Authentication and authorization examples must be secure
