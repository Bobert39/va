## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.5 implementation:
- Provider schedule service (src/services/provider_schedule.py) successfully implemented with FHIR R4 compliance
- Automatic refresh mechanism established with 15-minute intervals and health monitoring
- Data quality validation handles real EMR data issues (duplicates, missing data, inconsistent formats)
- PHI-safe audit logging implemented throughout all operations
- Comprehensive test coverage (32 unit tests, 7 integration tests) with proven patterns
- Cache TTL of 15 minutes established for schedule data with manual cache clearing capability

### Data Models
From existing implementation and architecture documents:
- **Session Data**: In-memory storage for active sessions with call_id, start_time, phone_hash, status [Source: architecture/data-models-minimal-for-mvp.md]
- **Configuration**: JSON-based configuration with practice_name, emr_credentials, api_keys, operational_hours [Source: architecture/data-models-minimal-for-mvp.md]
- **Provider Schedule Data**: FHIR R4 compliant Schedule, Slot, and Provider resources from Story 1.5 implementation
- **Appointment Data**: Retrieved via existing provider_schedule service, includes patient name, time, type, provider information

### API Specifications
Core endpoints already defined in architecture:
- **GET /api/v1/appointments/today**: Get today's AI appointments with Auth: Session [Source: architecture/simplified-api-specification.md]
- **GET /dashboard**: Serve admin dashboard with Auth: Basic Auth [Source: architecture/simplified-api-specification.md]
- **GET /api/v1/status**: System health check endpoint [Source: architecture/simplified-api-specification.md]
- **Additional endpoints needed**: GET /api/v1/appointments (with filters), GET /api/v1/providers

### Component Specifications
From architecture documents:
- **Frontend Technology**: Vanilla JavaScript ES2022 with no build process complexity [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md]
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5.3.x for responsive UI components and rapid development [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md]
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI 0.104.x for REST API serving with automatic OpenAPI docs [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md]
- **Existing Dashboard**: static/dashboard.html already exists with Bootstrap 5.3.0 and OAuth configuration sections

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure and architecture:
- **Static Files**: static/ directory for HTML, CSS, JavaScript files
- **API Endpoints**: Add to existing src/main.py FastAPI application
- **Services**: Integrate with existing src/services/provider_schedule.py
- **Templates**: No template engine - use vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap for UI [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md]

### Testing Requirements
From development workflow testing strategy:
- **Test File Locations**: tests/unit/ for unit tests, tests/integration/ for integration tests [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
- **Testing Framework**: pytest for test execution (following established patterns from Stories 1.4 and 1.5)
- **Frontend Testing**: Manual testing for MVP - validate responsive design and user interactions
- **API Testing**: Unit tests for FastAPI endpoints, integration tests with provider_schedule service
- **Security Testing**: Validate session management, authentication, and timeout functionality

### Technical Constraints
From architecture and previous implementation:
- **No Local Storage**: All patient and appointment data remains in EMR, no local database [Source: architecture/data-models-minimal-for-mvp.md]
- **PHI Protection**: No PHI logged in application logs or error messages (established in Story 1.3)
- **Session Management**: File-based session storage, 30-minute timeout requirement
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface required for basic viewing
- **Real-time Updates**: 5-minute polling interval (more frequent than 15-minute schedule refresh)

### Testing

**Test File Location**: `tests/unit/test_appointment_api.py`, `tests/integration/test_dashboard_integration.py`

**Test Standards**:

- Frontend manual testing for responsive design and user interactions
- Security testing for session management and authentication flows

**Testing Frameworks**:
- pytest for backend API testing following established patterns from Stories 1.4 and 1.5
- Manual testing for frontend JavaScript functionality and responsive design
- Integration testing with existing provider_schedule service infrastructure
- Follow testing patterns from Story 1.5 for service integration

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Test appointment data retrieval with various date ranges and provider filters
- Test real-time update mechanism with timing validation
- Test responsive design across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes
- Test session timeout and logout functionality
- Verify integration with existing provider_schedule service and data quality validation
