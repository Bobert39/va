## Dev Notes

### Production Architecture Considerations
Based on existing design:
- **Target Platform**: Windows 10+ standalone deployment with zero administration overhead
- **Service Architecture**: FastAPI with uvicorn ASGI server for production deployment
- **File-Based Storage**: Configuration and audit logs stored on local file system
- **External Dependencies**: OpenEMR integration, voice AI services, and cloud API connectivity

### Security Requirements Analysis
HIPAA compliance and security needs:
- **PHI Protection**: No PHI stored locally, all patient data remains in EMR
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail with tamper-proof logging
- **Encryption**: Configuration encryption and secure key management
- **Network Security**: HTTPS/TLS for all external communication

### Production Performance Targets
Based on architecture requirements:
- **Response Time**: API responses <200ms for critical operations
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime requirement (8.7 hours downtime per year)
- **Concurrency**: Support for multiple simultaneous voice calls
- **Resource Usage**: <100MB RAM baseline, <500MB under load

### Operational Complexity Assessment
Production deployment challenges:
- **Windows Deployment**: Service installation and management on Windows platforms
- **EMR Integration**: Network connectivity and authentication with external EMR systems
- **Voice AI Dependencies**: Cloud service integration and API key management
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Continuous HIPAA compliance validation and reporting

### Monitoring Strategy
Comprehensive monitoring approach:
- **Application Monitoring**: FastAPI health endpoints and service status
- **System Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization
- **Business Monitoring**: Appointment booking success rates and EMR connectivity
- **Security Monitoring**: Authentication failures and suspicious activity detection

### Deployment Models
Multiple deployment scenarios:
- **Single Practice**: Standalone installation at individual medical practice
- **Multi-Practice**: Centralized deployment serving multiple practices
- **Cloud Deployment**: Alternative cloud-based deployment for distributed practices
- **Hybrid Deployment**: Combination of on-premise and cloud components

### Maintenance Strategy
Ongoing operational procedures:
- **Automated Updates**: Security patches and dependency updates
- **Configuration Management**: Change control and version management
- **Performance Optimization**: Ongoing tuning and capacity planning
- **Compliance Auditing**: Regular HIPAA compliance validation and reporting

### Testing Requirements
Production deployment validation:
- **Deployment Testing**: Full deployment procedure testing on clean systems
- **Load Testing**: Performance validation under realistic load conditions
- **Security Testing**: Penetration testing and vulnerability assessment
- **Disaster Recovery Testing**: Regular backup and recovery procedure validation
