```

### Development Workflow Standards
[Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
- **Setup Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Note: Should adapt to Poetry for this story)
- **Configuration**: Use config.example.json pattern for configuration template
- **Local Access**: Application should run on http://localhost:8000/dashboard
- **Prerequisites**: Python 3.9+, Windows 10+, 8GB RAM minimum

### Data Models and Configuration
[Source: architecture/data-models-minimal-for-mvp.md]
- **No local database for patient data** - all patient/appointment data stays in EMR
- **Local configuration structure**:
  ```json
  {
    "practice_name": "...",
    "emr_credentials": "encrypted",
    "api_keys": "encrypted",
    "operational_hours": {...}
  }
  ```
- **Session data**: In-memory only with call tracking
- **Audit logs**: File-based audit.log for HIPAA compliance

### Core Components Architecture
[Source: architecture/core-components.md]
Key components that will be built in future stories but need infrastructure support:
- **VoiceCallHandler**: Complete voice call processing
- **EMRIntegrationService**: Direct OpenEMR communication
- **SecurityAndAuditService**: HIPAA compliance and security
- **SystemMonitoringService**: Operational monitoring
- **ConfigurationManager**: Practice settings management with encrypted JSON storage

### Deployment and CI/CD Requirements
[Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]
- **Target Platform**: Windows 10+ standalone Python application
- **Installation Method**: Single install.bat script for practices
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with Windows runner
- **Build Process**: PyInstaller for single executable creation
- **Requirements**: Windows 10+, 8GB RAM, Internet connection

```python
def test_audit_log_rotation():
    """Test log file rotation at size limits"""
    assert log_files_rotated_correctly()

def test_no_phi_in_logs():
    """Critical: Ensure no PHI appears in any log output"""
    assert no_sensitive_data_in_logs()
```

- **Audit Logging**: 90% coverage (HIPAA compliance requirement)
- **Application Startup**: 85% coverage (core functionality)
- **File System Operations**: 80% coverage (standard infrastructure)

#### Test Execution Standards
- **Local Development**: `poetry run pytest` with coverage report
- **Pre-commit**: Run tests automatically before each commit
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Full test suite execution on all pull requests
- **Failure Handling**: Zero tolerance for test failures in main branch

#### Test Documentation Requirements
- **Test Case Documentation**: Each test function must have descriptive docstring
- **Test Data Documentation**: Document test fixtures and their purposes
- **Coverage Reports**: Generate HTML coverage reports for review
- **Test Results**: Store test results artifacts in CI/CD pipeline
