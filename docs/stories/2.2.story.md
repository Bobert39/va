# Story 2.2: Natural Language Appointment Request Processing

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** patient,
**I want** to describe my appointment needs in natural language,
**so that** I don't have to use specific commands or technical phrases.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Extract patient name, preferred date/time, and appointment reason from natural speech
2. Handle various date formats ("tomorrow", "next Tuesday", "January 15th")
3. Understand appointment types ("checkup", "follow-up", "urgent", "consultation")
4. VALIDATION ADDED: Test with medical terminology and healthcare-specific language
5. COST CONTROL: Optimize API calls to minimize OpenAI usage costs
6. Confirmation of understood details before proceeding
7. Context retention throughout multi-turn conversation

- **HIPAA Audit Logging**: Extend existing audit logging for NLP entity extraction [Source: architecture/security-and-compliance.md]
- **Encrypted API Credentials**: Use existing configuration management for OpenAI API keys [Source: architecture/security-and-compliance.md]
