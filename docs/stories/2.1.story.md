# Story 2.1: Speech-to-Text Voice Processing

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** patient calling after hours,
**I want** the system to accurately understand my spoken words,
**so that** I can communicate my appointment needs naturally.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Real-time speech-to-text transcription with ≥85% accuracy on test phrases (reduced from 90% based on assumption testing)
2. Support for common speech patterns, accents, and speaking speeds
3. Audio input handling from standard phone system integration
4. VALIDATION ADDED: Testing with practice-representative phone audio quality
5. VALIDATION ADDED: Cost modeling to ensure API usage stays within $197/month target
6. Conversation timeout handling after 30 seconds of silence
7. Clear audio feedback when system cannot understand input

- [ ] Consider adding performance benchmarks for transcription latency

### Security Review

**EXCELLENT** - Implementation demonstrates strong security awareness:
- Phone numbers consistently hashed with SHA256 before any logging or storage
- API credentials properly abstracted through configuration system
- HIPAA-compliant audit logging with no PHI exposure
- Proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- Secure retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to prevent API abuse

- Async/await patterns properly implemented for I/O operations
- Built-in cost tracking and budget monitoring ($197/month threshold)
- Efficient session management with proper cleanup
- Real-time audio streaming support with configurable chunk sizes
- Retry logic with exponential backoff prevents API hammering

### Files Modified During Review

- tests/unit/services/test_voice_handler.py (fixed async test mocking)

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/2.1-speech-to-text-voice-processing.yml

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done - All acceptance criteria met, tests passing, excellent code quality with only minor future improvements suggested. This implementation is production-ready for MVP deployment.
