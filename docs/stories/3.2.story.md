# Story 3.2: System Configuration and Practice Settings (Updated)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** practice administrator,
**I want** to configure system settings for our specific practice,
**so that** the voice AI works correctly with our providers, hours, and policies.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Provider management (add/remove providers, set schedules, configure preferences)
2. Business hours configuration for voice AI availability
3. Appointment type setup with durations and scheduling rules
4. Practice information settings (name, address, phone, greeting customization)
5. **USER TESTING REQUIRED**: Configuration tested by actual healthcare staff with limited technical expertise
6. **SIMPLIFIED INTERFACE**: Setup wizard approach rather than complex configuration screens
7. All configuration changes take effect immediately without system restart

### Data Models
Extended configuration structure (building on existing config.json):
```python
# Existing configuration structure in ConfigurationManager
{
    "practice_name": "...",  # To be extended with full practice details
    "operational_hours": {    # Already exists, needs extension
        "monday": {"start": "09:00", "end": "17:00"},
        # ... other days
    },
    "system_settings": {...}, # Existing structure

    # NEW sections to add:
    "providers": [            # NEW structure for provider management
        {
            "id": "provider_uuid",
            "name": "Dr. Smith",
            "schedule": {...},
            "preferences": {...},
            "appointment_types": [...]
        }
    ],
    "appointment_types": [    # NEW structure for appointment types
        {
            "id": "type_uuid",
            "name": "Consultation",
            "duration_minutes": 30,
            "scheduling_rules": {...}
        }
    ],
    "practice_information": { # NEW extended practice details
        "full_name": "...",
        "address": {...},
        "phone": "...",
        "departments": [...],
        "greeting_customization": {...}
    }
}
```

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure:
- Configuration backend: `src/config.py` (ConfigurationManager class - extend existing)
- Configuration API: `src/main.py` (add new configuration endpoints)
- Dashboard UI: `static/dashboard.html` (extend with configuration UI)
- Dashboard JS: `static/dashboard.js` (add configuration management logic)
- New files to create:
  - `static/configuration-wizard.js` (setup wizard logic)
  - `static/configuration-wizard.css` (wizard-specific styles)
  - `tests/unit/test_configuration_extended.py` (extended config tests)
  - `tests/integration/test_configuration_api.py` (API endpoint tests)

### Testing Requirements
From testing strategy (derived from existing test patterns):
- Unit tests for all ConfigurationManager extensions
- Integration tests for configuration API endpoints
- UI component testing for wizard and forms
- Validation testing for all configuration changes
- User acceptance testing with non-technical users
- Real-time update testing without system restart

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing configuration structure
- All sensitive data must remain encrypted using existing Fernet encryption
- Configuration changes must not require system restart (per AC 7)
- UI must be simple enough for non-technical healthcare staff (per AC 5, 6)
- Must integrate with existing audit logging for HIPAA compliance
- Must use Bootstrap 5.3.x for UI consistency with existing dashboard

## Testing

### Test File Locations
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/test_configuration_extended.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_configuration_api.py`
- UI tests: `tests/ui/test_configuration_wizard.py` (if UI testing framework added)

### Test Standards
- Follow existing pytest patterns from Story 2.5 tests
- Maintain >80% code coverage for new configuration code
- Include error handling and edge case testing
- Test with realistic healthcare practice scenarios
- Validate non-technical user workflows

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- pytest for unit and integration testing (existing pattern)
- Mock external dependencies using unittest.mock
- Test configuration validation thoroughly
- Test encryption/decryption of new configuration sections
- Validate real-time update mechanism

### Story-Specific Testing Requirements
- Test wizard flow with incomplete data and resume capability
- Validate provider schedule conflict detection
- Test appointment type validation against provider capabilities
- Verify real-time configuration updates propagate without restart
- Test configuration rollback on validation failures
- Validate audit logging captures all configuration changes
