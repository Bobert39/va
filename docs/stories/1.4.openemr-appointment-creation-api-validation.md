## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist yet.

### API Specifications
Based on the simplified API specification, this story focuses on validating the underlying OpenEMR appointment APIs that will support the `/api/v1/voice/call` endpoint for appointment creation during voice processing. [Source: architecture/simplified-api-specification.md]

### EMR Integration Service Context
The EMRIntegrationService component is responsible for direct OpenEMR communication with key operations including appointment creation. This service maintains no local storage and keeps all data in the EMR system. [Source: architecture/core-components.md]

### Technology Stack Requirements
- Backend: Python 3.9+ with FastAPI 0.104.x for REST API development
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 standard for EMR integration
- External Calls: HTTPS required for all external API calls [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md]

### Security and Compliance
- HTTPS required for all external API calls to OpenEMR
- HIPAA audit logging to text files required for all EMR interactions
- No local PHI storage - all patient data must remain in EMR
- Encrypted API credentials in configuration [Source: architecture/security-and-compliance.md]

### Data Models
No local database required for this story. All appointment data remains in EMR. Only session data maintained in-memory and configuration in encrypted JSON. [Source: architecture/data-models-minimal-for-mvp.md]

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure:
- Main service files: `src/services/appointment.py` (new file)
- Test files: `tests/unit/services/test_appointment.py` (new file)
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_appointment_creation.py` (new file)
- Configuration: Existing `config.py` structure for API credentials

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.9+ environment requirement
- FastAPI framework for API development
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with OpenEMR
- File-based configuration and logging

### Testing Requirements
From development workflow testing strategy:
- Basic connectivity tests to verify EMR connection
- Appointment creation tests to validate booking functionality
- Error handling and validation tests
- Integration tests with real OpenEMR test instance [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

### Testing
**Test File Location**: `tests/unit/services/test_appointment.py` and `tests/integration/test_appointment_creation.py`

**Test Standards**:
- Unit tests for appointment service methods with mocked OpenEMR responses
- Integration tests with real OpenEMR test instance
- Error handling tests for network failures and invalid responses

**Testing Frameworks**:
- pytest for test execution based on existing project structure
- Mock OpenEMR API responses for unit testing
- Real OpenEMR test instance for integration testing

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Test appointment creation with various appointment types and providers
- Test conflict detection and double-booking scenarios
- Test appointment modification and cancellation workflows
- Verify appointments appear correctly in OpenEMR interface
- Document API limitations and required workarounds
