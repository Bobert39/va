# Story 1.3: Patient Lookup via FHIR API

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** practice staff member,
**I want** the system to find patient records by name and date of birth,
**so that** voice appointments can be linked to existing patient accounts.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. FHIR R4 Patient resource search by name and birthdate
2. Patient demographic data retrieval (name, DOB, contact info, insurance)
3. Multiple patient matching handled with disambiguation logic
4. API error handling for network failures and invalid responses
5. Patient search results cached for session performance
6. Search accuracy tested with minimum 20 test patient records
7. No PHI logged in application logs or error messages

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.2 OAuth implementation:

- OAuth client (EMROAuthClient) successfully implemented with token management
- Existing OAuth authentication can be reused for FHIR API calls
- Token refresh mechanism with 5-minute buffer already in place
- Comprehensive error handling patterns established (OAuthError hierarchy)
- Audit logging system operational at src/audit.py

### Technology Stack

[Source: architecture/technology-stack.md]

- Backend Language: Python 3.9+
- Backend Framework: FastAPI 0.104.x with automatic OpenAPI docs
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 (already implemented in story 1.2)
- Storage: File System for configuration and logs (no database)

### Data Models

[Source: architecture/data-models-minimal-for-mvp.md]

- No local database required - all patient data remains in EMR
- Session data stored in-memory only:

  ```python
  active_calls = {
      "call_id": {
          "start_time": datetime,
          "phone_hash": "sha256_hash",
          "status": "processing"
      }
  }
  ```

- Audit logs stored in audit.log with anonymized patient data

### API Specifications

[Source: architecture/simplified-api-specification.md]

- Authentication: Use existing OAuth session/API Key patterns
- Response format: JSON with status and data fields
- Error responses: Include status and user-friendly message

### EMR Integration Service

[Source: architecture/core-components.md#EMRIntegrationService]

- Responsibility: Direct OpenEMR communication
- Key Operations: Patient lookup, appointment creation
- No Local Storage: All data remains in EMR
- Integration point: Extend existing EMROAuthClient in src/services/emr.py

### File Locations

Based on existing project structure:

- Service implementation: src/services/fhir_patient.py (new file)
- API endpoints: src/main.py (add to existing FastAPI app)
- Unit tests: tests/unit/fhir/test_fhir_patient_service.py (new file)
- Integration tests: tests/integration/fhir/test_patient_search.py (new file)
- E2E tests: tests/e2e/fhir/test_patient_lookup_e2e.py (new file)

### Testing Requirements

Based on established patterns from story 1.2:

- Use pytest framework (already configured)
- Follow existing test structure in tests/ directory
- Mock external FHIR calls using httpx.AsyncClient mocking
- Test file naming: test_*.py
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new service code
- Integration tests use mock OpenEMR responses
- E2E tests optional but recommended against local OpenEMR

### Technical Constraints

- FHIR R4 specification compliance required
- Must handle OpenEMR's FHIR implementation quirks
- Response time <2 seconds for patient search
- Cache TTL of 5 minutes to balance performance and data freshness
- No PHI in logs - use SHA256 hashing for patient identifiers
- Reuse OAuth tokens from story 1.2 implementation

### Security Considerations

[Source: architecture/security-and-compliance.md]

- HIPAA compliance mandatory
- All patient data must be encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- No patient data stored locally
- Audit all patient searches
- PHI must be redacted from all logs

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-21

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation with comprehensive FHIR R4 compliance. The FHIRPatientService demonstrates strong architectural patterns with proper separation of concerns, robust error handling, and thorough PHI protection measures. Code follows established patterns and demonstrates high maintainability.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/services/fhir_patient.py

  - **Why**: Incorrect exception reference was causing test failures
  - **How**: Updated both service code and unit tests to use correct httpx API

- **File**: src/services/fhir_patient.py
  - **Change**: Removed unused imports (datetime, timedelta, urlencode, OAuthError)
  - **Why**: Improves code cleanliness and prevents linting warnings
  - **How**: Cleaned up import statements after analyzing actual usage

- **File**: src/services/fhir_patient.py
  - **Change**: Applied Black code formatting
  - **Why**: Ensures consistent code style across project
  - **How**: Ran poetry run black to auto-format code
