## Dev Notes

### Documentation Structure
Based on project organization:
- **Location**: `docs/setup/` directory with organized sub-documents
- **Format**: Markdown with clear headings and code blocks
- **Integration**: Link from main README.md and architecture docs
- **Maintenance**: Include version compatibility matrix

### Configuration Analysis
From existing implementation:
- **Config File**: `config.json` with encrypted sensitive fields
- **Environment Variables**: Support for dev/prod environment overrides
- **Practice Settings**: EMR credentials, API keys, operational hours
- **Security**: Encryption keys and audit logging configuration

### Installation Complexity Assessment
Current setup challenges identified:
- **Poetry Setup**: Not standard in many environments, needs detailed explanation
- **Windows Focus**: Target deployment platform requires Windows-specific instructions
- **EMR Integration**: Complex OAuth setup with external system dependencies
- **File Permissions**: Audit logging and configuration file access requirements

### User Personas for Documentation
- **New Developer**: First-time contributor needing complete guidance
- **System Administrator**: Production deployment focused on security and reliability
- **DevOps Engineer**: Automation and containerization requirements
- **Practice Manager**: Non-technical user doing basic installation verification

### Testing Requirements
Documentation testing approach:
- **Fresh Environment Testing**: Validate instructions on clean Windows 10 system
- **User Testing**: Have non-technical user follow setup guide
- **Command Validation**: Verify all code examples and commands work correctly
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Ensure consistency with architecture documentation

## Testing

### Test File Location
- **Documentation Tests**: `tests/infrastructure/` directory
- **User Journey Tests**: `tests/e2e/setup/` directory (to be created)
- **Documentation Validation**: `docs/setup/validation/` directory (to be created)

### Test Standards
From architecture documentation and existing test structure:
- **Test Framework**: pytest (consistent with existing `tests/` structure)
- **Environment Testing**: Fresh Windows 10+ virtual machines for validation
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Real users following documentation step-by-step
- **Command Verification**: All bash/PowerShell commands tested in target environments

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
Based on existing project structure:
- **pytest** for automated validation of setup commands and configuration
- **Infrastructure tests** pattern (following `tests/infrastructure/` structure)
- **End-to-end validation** for complete setup workflows
- **Manual user testing** with structured feedback collection

### Specific Testing Requirements for This Story
**Documentation Validation Tests:**
1. **Fresh Environment Setup Test**:
   - Clean Windows 10 VM follows complete setup guide
   - Measure time to completion vs. acceptance criteria (< 10 minutes for experienced devs)
   - Document all errors/blockers encountered

2. **Multi-Persona Validation**:
   - New Developer: Complete setup following comprehensive guide
   - System Administrator: Production setup with security hardening
   - DevOps Engineer: Docker containerization path
   - Practice Manager: Basic installation verification

3. **Command Accuracy Test**:
   - Every code block/command in documentation executed and verified
   - All curl examples tested against running system
   - Configuration examples validated for syntax and functionality

4. **Success Metrics Validation**:
   - Track setup success rate (target: 95%)
   - Measure average setup time per persona
   - Monitor reduction in setup-related support tickets (target: 70% reduction)

5. **Cross-Platform Testing** (if expanded beyond Windows):
   - Validate setup instructions work on different Windows versions
   - Test compatibility with different Python/Poetry versions

**Test Data Requirements:**
- Sample config.json files for different environments (dev/test/prod)
- Mock EMR credentials for testing integration setup
- Test appointment data for validation scenarios
