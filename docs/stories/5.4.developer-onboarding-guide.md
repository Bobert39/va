## Dev Notes

### Current Development Stack
From existing implementation:
- **Language**: Python 3.9+ with Poetry dependency management
- **Framework**: FastAPI 0.104.x with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage reporting and comprehensive test organization
- **Code Quality**: Black, flake8, mypy, pre-commit hooks for automated quality enforcement
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with automated testing, linting, and Windows build artifacts

### Codebase Complexity Assessment
Architecture complexity for new developers:
- **Service Architecture**: 20+ services in `src/services/` with clear separation of concerns
- **Configuration Management**: Encrypted JSON configuration with validation and audit logging
- **EMR Integration**: Complex FHIR R4 integration with OAuth 2.0 authentication
- **Voice AI Pipeline**: Integration with external AI services and natural language processing

### Learning Path Strategy
Progressive complexity introduction:
1. **Foundation**: Basic FastAPI, configuration, and testing patterns
2. **Service Layer**: Understanding service architecture and dependency injection
3. **EMR Integration**: FHIR R4, OAuth 2.0, and healthcare compliance requirements
4. **Advanced Features**: Voice AI processing, conflict resolution, and real-time updates

### New Developer Pain Points
Common challenges identified:
- **Domain Complexity**: Healthcare, EMR systems, and FHIR standards learning curve
- **Configuration Setup**: Complex encrypted configuration and EMR connectivity
- **Testing Strategy**: Understanding unit vs integration testing with external service mocking
- **Compliance Requirements**: HIPAA compliance and PHI handling throughout codebase

### Mentorship Integration
Onboarding support structure:
- **Buddy System**: Pair new developers with experienced team members
- **Progressive Responsibility**: Start with documentation/testing, progress to feature development
- **Knowledge Validation**: Regular check-ins and code review feedback
- **Domain Expert Access**: Connect with EMR integration and healthcare compliance experts

### Documentation Integration
Connect with existing documentation:
- **Architecture Documents**: Link to comprehensive architecture documentation
- **Story Development**: Reference completed stories for implementation patterns
- **API Documentation**: Integrate with API reference and integration guides
- **Troubleshooting**: Connect to troubleshooting guide for common development issues

### Practical Learning Approach
Hands-on learning opportunities:
- **Starter Tasks**: Well-defined issues suitable for new contributors
- **Code Reading**: Guided tours through well-implemented features
- **Pair Programming**: Collaborative development sessions with experienced developers
- **Documentation Contribution**: Contributing to documentation as a learning exercise

### Testing Requirements
Onboarding guide validation:
- **New Developer Testing**: Have actual new team members follow the guide
- **Feedback Integration**: Incorporate feedback from onboarding experiences
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular updates based on new developer feedback
- **Tool Validation**: Ensure all recommended tools and configurations work correctly
