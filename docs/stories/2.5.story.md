### File Locations
Based on existing project structure:
- Create TTS service: `src/services/tts_service.py` (new file)
- Extend conversation manager: `src/services/conversation_manager.py` (existing file - add confirmation flows)
- Update voice handler: `src/services/voice_handler.py` (existing file - integrate TTS confirmation)
- Update configuration: `src/config.py` (existing file - add TTS configuration)
- Update audit logging: `src/audit.py` (existing file - extend for TTS events)
- Tests: `tests/unit/services/test_tts_service.py`, `tests/unit/services/test_conversation_manager.py`, `tests/integration/test_voice_confirmation_flow.py`

### Technical Constraints
- Real-time TTS generation during voice calls with minimal latency (<3 seconds)
- Integration with existing VoiceCallHandler and ConversationManager architecture
- HIPAA-compliant audio handling and no local storage of generated audio files
- Professional medical communication standards for appointment confirmations
- Conversation efficiency - maximum 3-5 voice exchanges as per acceptance criteria
- Twilio Voice integration for audio streaming and real-time conversation handling
- OpenAI TTS API rate limits and cost optimization considerations

### Testing
- **Test Location**: Tests should be placed in `tests/` directory following existing structure
- **Testing Framework**: Use pytest as indicated by existing pyproject.toml [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#testing-strategy-mvp]
- **Test Standards**: Basic tests only for MVP - verify connectivity, functionality, and voice operations [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md#testing-strategy-mvp]
- **Requirements for this story**:
  - Unit tests for TTS service audio generation and quality
  - Integration tests for complete voice confirmation workflow
  - Conversation flow testing with exchange count validation
  - Audio quality and pronunciation accuracy testing
  - Error handling and graceful hangup scenario testing
  - Performance tests for real-time TTS generation during calls

### Security Considerations
- **No Local Audio Storage**: Generated TTS audio should not be stored locally [Source: architecture/security-and-compliance.md]
- **HIPAA Audit Logging**: Extend existing audit logging for TTS generation events [Source: architecture/security-and-compliance.md]
- **Encrypted API Credentials**: Use existing configuration management for TTS API access [Source: architecture/security-and-compliance.md]
- **HTTPS for External APIs**: Leverage existing security patterns for TTS API calls [Source: architecture/security-and-compliance.md]

### Project Structure Notes
Following existing patterns established in previous stories:
- Services in `src/services/` directory
- Tests organized by type (unit/integration) in `tests/` directory
- Configuration management through existing `src/config.py` patterns
- Integration with existing VoiceCallHandler and ConversationManager infrastructure
