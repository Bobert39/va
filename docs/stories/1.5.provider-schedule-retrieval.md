# Story 1.5: Provider Schedule Retrieval

## Status
Done
## Story
**As a** practice staff member,
**I want** the system to display provider schedules and availability,
**so that** I can verify appointment slots before voice booking begins.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Retrieve provider schedules via OpenEMR appointment API
2. Display available time slots for next 30 days by provider
3. Show existing appointments to identify conflicts
4. Handle multiple provider schedules in single practice
5. Schedule data refreshed automatically every 15 minutes
6. Provider working hours and break times properly represented
7. **VALIDATION ADDED**: Test with real EMR data quality issues (duplicates, missing data, inconsistent formats)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 (OpenEMR Appointment Creation API Validation):
- Successfully implemented FHIR R4 compliant appointment service in src/services/appointment.py
- OAuth configuration includes Appointment.read and Appointment.write scopes already configured
- Comprehensive error handling patterns established for OpenEMR API interactions
- PHI-safe audit logging implementation available for reuse
- Robust testing framework established (43 tests with 89% coverage pattern)
- FHIR R4 compliance validation patterns already implemented

### API Specifications
Based on the simplified API specification, this story builds upon the OpenEMR appointment APIs used in Story 1.4. The provider schedule functionality will eventually support the `/api/v1/voice/call` endpoint by providing availability verification during voice processing. [Source: architecture/simplified-api-specification.md]

### EMR Integration Service Context
The EMRIntegrationService component handles direct OpenEMR communication with key operations including patient lookup and appointment creation. This story extends that service to include provider schedule operations. The service maintains no local storage and keeps all data in the EMR system. [Source: architecture/core-components.md]

### Technology Stack Requirements
- Backend: Python 3.9+ with FastAPI 0.104.x for REST API development
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 standard for EMR integration (already configured from Story 1.4)
- External Calls: HTTPS required for all external API calls [Source: architecture/technology-stack.md]

### Security and Compliance
- HTTPS required for all external API calls to OpenEMR
- HIPAA audit logging to text files required for all EMR interactions
- No local PHI storage - all provider and appointment data must remain in EMR
- Encrypted API credentials in configuration [Source: architecture/security-and-compliance.md]

### Data Models
No local database required for this story. All provider schedule data remains in EMR. Only session data maintained in-memory and configuration in encrypted JSON. Provider schedule data should be cached temporarily for performance but not persisted. [Source: architecture/data-models-minimal-for-mvp.md]

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure:
- Main service files: `src/services/provider_schedule.py` (new file)
- Test files: `tests/unit/services/test_provider_schedule.py` (new file)
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_provider_schedule_retrieval.py` (new file)
- Configuration: Existing `config.py` structure for API credentials
- Extend existing EMR service patterns from `src/services/appointment.py`

### Technical Constraints
- Python 3.9+ environment requirement
- FastAPI framework for API development
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with OpenEMR (already configured)
- File-based configuration and logging
- 15-minute automatic refresh requirement for schedule data

### Testing Requirements
From development workflow testing strategy:
- Basic connectivity tests to verify EMR connection (reuse patterns from Story 1.4)
- Provider schedule retrieval tests to validate data fetching functionality
- Schedule refresh automation tests
- Data quality validation tests for real EMR data issues [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]

### Testing
**Test File Location**: `tests/unit/services/test_provider_schedule.py` and `tests/integration/test_provider_schedule_retrieval.py`

**Test Standards**:
- Unit tests for provider schedule service methods with mocked OpenEMR responses
- Integration tests with real OpenEMR test instance
- Error handling tests for network failures, invalid responses, and data quality issues
- Automated refresh mechanism testing

**Testing Frameworks**:
- pytest for test execution based on existing project structure
- Mock OpenEMR API responses for unit testing
- Real OpenEMR test instance for integration testing
- Follow testing patterns established in Story 1.4

**Specific Testing Requirements**:
- Test provider list retrieval with various practice configurations
- Test schedule data parsing with different provider working hour formats
- Test automatic refresh mechanism with timing validation
- Test data quality handling: duplicates, missing data, format inconsistencies
- Verify schedule calculations correctly identify available time slots
- Test multi-provider scenarios with different schedules and working hours

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-21

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid FHIR R4 compliance and comprehensive provider schedule functionality. The code architecture follows good separation of concerns with distinct classes for Schedule, Slot, Provider, and the main service. Data quality validation is particularly well-implemented with duplicate detection and validation error tracking. The automatic refresh mechanism is robust with proper error handling and health monitoring.
